## Greetings, welcome to my Github Profile!

### My name is [Zhou Yi Kelvin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhou-yi-kelvin/), a Penultimate Computer Science and Business Administration Student in National University of Singapore.

### Currently, I am a Software Engineer Intern at [Ninja Van](https://www.ninjavan.co/en-sg) in Singapore. My main task for this internship is to migrate a page developed in Angular to a React repository, that will be hoisted by an i-Frame as a Micro FrontEnd. I have also contributed by fixing bugs, addding features and improving engineering practices for both the Backend and Frontend codebase.

### In my previous Software Engineering Internships, I developed a Hotel Kiosk and Lock Access Control using B4J, and co-developed a Website using Angular.

### For most of my life since secondary school, I volunteered actively in Singapore Red Cross Youth from 2015 to 2021, attaining the rank of Volunteer Officer, and taking up large scale appointments, such as Assistant Head of Red Cross Knowledge, as well as Chief Trainer of Warrant Officers' Programme 2019.

### In my univeristy, I am the Vice President (Internal) of the Intellectual Games Club. My main sport that I play is International Chess, and I regular live stream our Inter Varsity tournament with other tertiary institutions. I am also a titled Arbiter in the Singapore Chess Federation, and have arbitered at National events such as National Chess Championships.

### During my time arbitering for the National Chess Championships, I created an Enter/Exit Timesheet to help the organizing team keep track of the movement of the players. The previous practice was to use a physical sign in and sign out sheet. This online timesheet helped reduce the time players spend signing in and signing out, as well as generate metrics for the organizing team to conduct investigations if necessary. Here is a screenshot of the website:
